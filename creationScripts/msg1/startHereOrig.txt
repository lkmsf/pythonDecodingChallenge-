Hey! Hey you! I need your help. I can't explain everything now but the message I sent you was corrupted. It's close but some of the keys are wrong each "abectik" should map to "cebikta" (a should be replaced by c, b -> e, etc). I'll explain everything later, just trust me. Oh also, I managed to get ahold of one of the programs they're using to corrupt some of our messages. Hope it helps. Good luck!!
