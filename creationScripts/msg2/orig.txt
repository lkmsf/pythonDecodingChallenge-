Hi again! If you're reading this, nice job reverse engineering their encoding program and decrypting my message - we picked the right person for the job! We only have one chance to get this right. We think they're intercepting our messages so I can only send so much info at a time, and it has to be encrypted. I can tell you that we need their admin password to reverse the damage. Luckily employee #5890 has a hard time remembering their password and started to create a python program that also generated their password. Unfortunately, it's not finished, they don't seem all that great at debugging or documentation or using descriptive names for variables and functions. We really can't make heads or tails of it but we think you have a shot at it. I hear they like harry potter - maybe it'll be helpful?
